\begin{resumeSubSectionBody}

    I specialize in high performance computing (HPC), and computational physics.
    I have extensive experience in using co-processors, primarily Nvidia GPUs,
    and have a keen interest to further explore the accelerator landscape.

    I have a strong interest in writing high quality software: using modern
    tools, techniques, and design patterns.
    I'm particularly interested in writing high-performance tools and libraries
    which address bottlenecks in existing systems, and enable novel avenues of
    research \& development, enabling the development of high-quality software
    for others.

    I have a strong background in C\verb!++!, and consider it my ``goto''
    language.
    However, I have developed and worked on libraries and applications in a wide

    \emph{PhD Student}                 & \emph{2013 - 2017}

\end{resumeSubSectionHeader}
\begin{resumeSubSectionBody}

    Investigated numerical techniques for understanding how rocks record
    changes in the earth's magnetic field. This was done primarily through
    the lens of micromagnetic modelling, using high-performance finite element
    analysis, C\verb!++! and Fortran.

    \begin{resumeItemize}
        \item
            Developed theory and computational techniques for including
            magnetostrictive and multi-phase effects in non-uniformly-magnetized
            3D finite-element micromagnetic models with free boundaries.  This
            was implemented in our group's Fortran-based micromagnetics code,
            MERRILL, with results presented at conferences, and published in a
            thesis.

        \item
            Developed a meshing application in C\verb!++!, MEshRRILL, leveraging
            the CGAL library to generate unstructured meshes for micromagnetic
            simulations.
            The application generates meshes for a number of pre-defined shapes,
            typical for ferromagnetic crystals, but also generates
            surface reconstructions of geometries from coarse tomography images.
            Data generated by this software has been used in publications.

        \item
            Developed software, HoloMag, written in C\verb!++! and Python to
            produce simulated electron holography data from micromagnetic
            models.
            This is provided as a ParaView plugin and has been optimized to
            produce holography results in near real-time, allowing researchers
            to develop an intuition for how 3D magnetizations effect the 2D
            holography images.
            Data generated by this software has been used in publications.

        \item
            Developed workflows for compiling software for reliable
            distribution.
            This included building as-static-as-possible versions of programs
            like MERRILL, along with shared-library version of MEshRRILL with
            all dependencies installed in a subdirectory and RPATHs set
            appropriately, so it could easily be used and linked as a C++
            library to mesh complex user-defined geometries.
            HoloMag was also compiled to be ABI-compatible with ParaView
            binaries downloaded from the ParaView website.
