\begin{resumeSubSectionHeader}

    \textbf{Dublin Web Summit Limited} & Dublin, Ireland    \\
    \emph{Technical Analyst}           & \emph{Summer 2012}

\end{resumeSubSectionHeader}
\begin{resumeSubSectionBody}

    Evaluated new technologies for use in projects.
    Built and maintained applications for internal and external use.
    Analysed and modified applications to handle higher user loads
    as necessary.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            Developed browser based app leveraging Facebook's
            JavaScript API to find users attending a Facebook event
            and list them in order of mutual friends with the current user,
            displaying those mutual friends, and showing which of them
            were also attending the event.
            This was tested against an event of about 3000 attendees and
            loaded results in several seconds.

        \item
            Analysed ticketing system used for event, identified features
            causing the system to slow to an unacceptable pace when the
            user base grew large enough and suggested alternative
            approaches.

        \item
            Implemented caching and distribution of content through a CDN
            for the main site when hosting servers began straining under
            high traffic.

        \item
            Researched IaaS platforms, deployments in cloud environments
            and NoSQL database systems for use with apps being built in
            house.
    \end{itemize}

\end{resumeSubSectionHeader}
\begin{resumeSubSectionBody}

    Investigated alignment errors found in experiments which used an
    ellipsoidal plasma mirror.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            Set up computer simulation of experimental setup using
            Zemax optics software.

        \item
            Investigated alignment errors due to geometric effects
            using ray tracing models, and compared them
            to diffractive errors by using wave front propagation models.

        \item
            Set up a physical optics bench to attempt to reproduce the
            errors, and play about with the system.
