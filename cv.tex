        \item Developed browser based app leveraging Facebook's
              JavaScript API to find users attending a Facebook event
              and list them in order of mutual friends, displaying those
              mutual friends, and showing which of those were also
              attending the event. This was tested against an event of
              about 3000 attendees.

        \item Analyzed ticketing system used for event, identifying features
              causing the system to perform very poorly when the userbase
              passed a certain size.

        \item Implemented caching and set up CDN properly for event site
              when it began to start crashing under high load.

        \item Researched NoSQL database systems, primarily CouchDB, Neo4j
              and MongoDB for use in apps being built in house.

        \item Investigated alignment errors due to geometric effects
              by using ray tracing techniques, and comparing them
              to diffractive errors by using physical optics propagation.

        \item Set up a physical optics bench to attempt to reproduce the
              errors, and play about with the system.

{\small

    \noindent
    Course centered around building high performance applications,
    primarily through parallelization, and through deep understanding
    of the underlying architecture of a given system.
    It also included modules on software engineering techniques, so
    while highly performant code was being written, they were in the form
    of maintainable projects using best practice coding techniques.

    \noindent
    Primary goal of the course was to teach problem solving and
    analytical thinking, along with the tools necessary to break down
    and understand complex problems.
    Joint effort by both the School of Maths and the School of Physics,
    this course offered training as both a mathematician and a
    physicist.
    Training aimed primarily towards understanding condensed matter
    physics from the physics side, and quantum field theory and general
    relativity from the maths side.
    Completed a dissertation on accelerating particle physics calculations
    on GPUs using CUDA C.

    Training in Theoretical Physics fostered a strong ability to
    analyse complex problems and devise and implement solutions to them.
    Training in High Performance Computing encouraged the application
    of these skills to creating highly performant code to solve
    a given problem.
